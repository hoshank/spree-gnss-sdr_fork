non_adversarial_static.conf:
Runs a real world trace that caputred in a field. 

non_adversarial_dynamic.conf:
Runs a real world trace that caputred during a drive. 

adversarial_coherent_500ns.conf:
Runs a trace that contains two satellite signals, one authentic and another 
spoofed signal. The peak of the spoofed signal is about 500 ns away from the authentic one.

adversarial_coherent_1000ns.conf:
Runs a trace that contains two satellite signals, one authentic and another 
spoofed signal. The peak of the spoofed signal is about 1000 ns away from the authentic one.

adversarial_noncoherent.conf:
Runs a trace that contains two satellite signals, one authentic and another 
spoofed signal. The spoofed signal is not coherent with the authentic one. Both its ephemeris data and
code phase are different.
